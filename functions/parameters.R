## Warning: No Sanity Checks are performed for most parameters
## Bad choices might lead to undesired behavior or infinite loops
## Activate runtime output parameters to check program behavior during runtime

##color Options
#background Colors: for all Elements of backgroundColors, all Stimuli will be created
#if no background coloring is desired, use 'none', the background image will be kept the way it is
backgroundColors=c('white','black')
#color of the borders of the cubes
borderColor='black'
#list of vector of colors (output will be generated for each element of the list)
#c('white','grey') for checkered pattern (more than 2 possible)
#order of colors matters
#colors can also be specified by "#rrggbb"
colorList=list('white',c('white','grey'))


##folders and formats
#base Folder for output relative to working directory
baseFolder="figs\\"
#Use angle differences to base angle or total rotation angle for naming output files?
addBaseAngle=FALSE
#image to use as a starting point for the background
backgroundImage='data\\background.png'
#file format of images, all image types supported by magick should be possible
fileFormat="png"
#width of image (height is adjusted accordingly, use quadratic images for best results)

#cube diameter in pixels
#use pixelDiameter=1 if only the points are supposed to be drawn

#calculate rotations by 0 degrees for each axis?
#unrotated base models are always saved, this option saves another copy for every axis
zeroRotations=FALSE

##model parameters
#list of orientations
#a - original
#b - mirrored along yz-plane

#difference between two angles in single axis rotations in deg
angleDiff=15
#calculate combined rotations?
combinedRotations=TRUE

angleDiffCombined=45
#which models to use
